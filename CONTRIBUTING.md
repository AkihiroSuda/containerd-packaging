# Contributing

Contributions should be made via pull requests. Pull requests will be reviewed
by one or more maintainers and merged when acceptable.

The goal of the containerd packaging project is to enable developers to package [containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd).

## Applying License Header to New Files

If you submit a contribution that adds a new file, please add the license
header. You can do so manually or use the `ltag` tool:

```console
$ go get github.com/kunalkushwaha/ltag
$ ltag -t ./script/validate/template
```

The above will add the appropriate license header to Go language source files,
Makefiles, Dockerfiles, and shell scripts. New templates will need to be added
if other kinds of files are added. Please consult the
documentation at https://github.com/kunalkushwaha/ltag

## Sign your work

The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the explanation for the patch. Your
signature certifies that you wrote the patch or otherwise have the right to pass
it on as an open-source patch. The rules are pretty simple: if you can certify
the below (from [developercertificate.org](http://developercertificate.org/)):

```
Developer Certificate of Origin
Version 1.1

Copyright (C) 2004, 2006 The Linux Foundation and its contributors.
660 York Street, Suite 102,
San Francisco, CA 94110 USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
    this project or the open source license(s) involved.
```

Then you just add a line to every git commit message:

    Signed-off-by: Joe Smith <joe.smith@email.com>

Use your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions.)

If you set your `user.name` and `user.email` git configs, you can sign your
commit automatically with `git commit -s`.
